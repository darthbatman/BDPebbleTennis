# BDPebbleTennis
Pebble smartwatch  and iPhone application for a tennis player and coach to track strokes the tennis player is making with his/her racket.
Through an iPhone app, the user could set the emails of himself/herself and the coach. 
When a user decides to end the tennis match or practice and ends the session on the iPhone app, the app would send an email to the user and the coach. 
This email includes the number of strokes of each type (forehand, backhand, topspin, and slice) that the user hit correctly. 
The goal of the app is for the player to better himself/herself at tennis, and for the coach to track the player's progress.

Won Best Use of Pebble, Best Use of Sendgrid, Best Hardware Hack, and 2nd Place Overall at HackRU Fall 2015
